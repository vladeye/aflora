# aflora
# This project was made in cygwin
# It has a shell script that is the starting point of the programm categories.sh
# It has two files to execute the operations made in python save.py and retreive.py
# It uses sqlite3 and the database it creates was named Categories
# I fixed the save.py file to bring all the categories 2016/03/23 I added a little something to 
# bring the information by chunks in that way we don't have a problem with the memory
